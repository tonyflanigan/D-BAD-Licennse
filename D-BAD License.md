## 📖 What is this?

The **D-BAD License** is an ethical source license designed for developers who want to share their work freely with good people, while explicitly withholding permission from bad actors.

It combines the permissive freedom of licenses like **MIT** with a moral clause inspired by South African slang and common sense.

- **D-BAD** = **D**on't **B**e **A** **D**OOS (For the good guys)
- **B-BAD** = **B**eing **A** **D**OOS, **D**eliberately (For the bad guys)

## 🎯 The Philosophy

Standard open-source licenses grant permissions to *everyone*, regardless of intent. The D-BAD License operates on a **Trust but Verify** model:

1.  **Good Faith:** If you are building cool things, helping people, or making money honestly, you have full permission. You are trusted by default.
2.  **Bad Faith:** If you are scamming, harassing, building malware, or being harmful, you are not welcome. The license offers you no protection.

## 🚀 How to Use This License

If you want to license your own project under D-BAD:

1.  **Copy the License:** Save the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file in the root of your repository.
2.  **Update Copyright:** Change the year and copyright holder name at the bottom of the license file.
3.  **Add a Badge:** (Optional) Add the badge to your project README to let users know what they're dealing with.
4.  **Header:** Optionally add a short header to your source files:
    ```text
    // Licensed under D-BAD v1.1 — Don't Be A DOOS.
    // Copyright (c) [Year] [Your Name]
    ```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this OSI Approved?
**No.** This is a custom ethical license. It is not compatible with strict corporate legal frameworks that require OSI-approved licenses (like MIT, Apache, GPL). Use with caution in enterprise environments.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?
**Yes.** If you are acting in good faith, you may use, modify, and sell software under this license.

### What happens if I violate the license?
You lose the rights granted by the license. Additionally, the author reserves the right to publicly disassociate from your project and call out your behaviour (without doxxing or threats).

### Is this legal advice?
**Absolutely not.** I am not a lawyer. This is a community-driven license text. If you need enforceable legal protection, consult an attorney.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer
