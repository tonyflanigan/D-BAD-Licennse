PLAIN-ENGLISH SUMMARY (Not Legally Binding)

Bad people: we see you, we don't like you, and we won't protect you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. GRANT OF PERMISSION

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of
the Software, subject to the terms below.

You are trusted by default.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. D-BAD SECTION — FOR THE GOOD GUYS

D-BAD = Don't Be A DOOS
("DOOS" being South African slang for a cunt / general human malfunction.)

If you are acting in good faith — meaning you are not deliberately harming
others, lying, scamming, stalking, exploiting, or being a general DOOS — then:

• You are welcome here
• You may use the Software freely
• You may build commercial or non-commercial things
• You will receive the full benefit of this licence
• You are assumed to have a functioning conscience

Thank you for not being awful. We genuinely appreciate you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. B-BAD SECTION — FOR THE BAD ACTORS

B-BAD = Being A DOOS, Deliberately

If you use this Software for intentionally harmful, deceptive, abusive, or
illegal purposes, including (but not limited to):

• Fraud, scams, or impersonation
• Harassment, coercion, or surveillance
• Malware, spyware, or covert data abuse
• Deliberate violations of applicable law

Then the following applies:

1. You are no longer welcome.
2. This licence does not protect you.
3. Any harm you cause is entirely your responsibility.

The author:

• Will not actively hunt you down
• Will not run surveillance or targeted investigations

However…

The author reserves the right to publicly criticise, disassociate from, or
describe (as opinion) the behaviour of parties who are credibly shown to be
acting as B-BADs.

This may include:

• Public statements of disapproval
• Withdrawal of support or acknowledgement
• Clear moral judgement of conduct

This is not a promise of fairness, neutrality, or politeness.

If you behave like a DOOS, you may be described as such.

(No doxxing. No threats. No lies presented as fact. Just opinion and consequences.)
